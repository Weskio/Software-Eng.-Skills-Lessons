*Fundamentals of Software Testing*

- Software testing is the process of checking the software's accuracy into account of all its properties( reusability, reliability, scalability, portability and usability)

- Verification process checks whether the program aligns with the documentation requirements 

- Validation process checks the software accuracy

- Manual testing means manually checking the functionalities in accordance with the needs of the client. To ensure thoroughness, testers employ test plans, test cases or test scenarios.

- Automation testing involves transforming any manual test cases into test scripts with the help of automation technologies or any programming language.

- Black box testing involves testing techniques that checks functionality of a software without delving into the code itself. i.e customer specified requirement specification. i.e code invisible

- White box testing involves checking every line of code before passing it to the test engineer. i.e system's internal perspective. i.e code visible

- Black box testing/ Closed box testing / Data-driven testing

- White box testing/ Structural testing / Clear box testing

- Levels of Software Testing starts from : Unit Testing --> Integration Testing --> System Testing --> Acceptance Testing





*Unit Testing*

- Unit testing is done on smallest testable parts of the code like functions, methods, module, procedure or class. 

- It's usually the first level of testing

- Unit testing can be proved crucial for reasons like early bug detection, better code writing, simplifying debugging and provision of documentation
